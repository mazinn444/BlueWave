## 🔧 App Data

BlueWave saves your playlists, volume and last played song in a small data file so everything loads fast when you return.

If you want a full reset, just delete the app’s data folder and it will recreate everything automatically.

## 🥔 What is “Potato Mode”?

Some PCs struggle with real-time audio visualizers.
Potato Mode turns them off and removes heavy animations, making BlueWave run much faster on low-end hardware.

## 📌 Note

Some features may still be in development as the app is in beta.
We’re working to polish everything and bring you the best experience.
